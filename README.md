## Introduction

This project demonstrates the powerful capabilities of TinyML by implementing a gesture-controlled lighting system. It utilizes a microcontroller, a camera, and a pre-trained neural network model to recognize hand gestures in real-time, triggering corresponding LED lights.

## Features

- **Compact and Efficient**: Runs on a lightweight, low-power microcontroller.
- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition**: Immediate response to hand gestures.
- **Scalable and Customizable**: Easily adaptable for additional gestures or devices.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Control lighting with simple hand gestures.
- **Innovative Integration**: Combines computer vision and TinyML.

## Hardware Requirements

- Microcontroller (e.g., ARM Cortex-M series)
- Camera/Image Sensor
- LED Bulbs
- Breadboard and connecting wires

## Software Requirements

- [TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers)
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
- Python (for training the model, if necessary)
- [OpenMV IDE](https://openmv.io/pages/download) (if using OpenMV Cam)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gesture-controlled-lighting.git
   cd gesture-controlled-lighting
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO installed. Follow the setup instructions for [TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers/get_started).

3. **Upload the Code:**
   Open the project in your preferred IDE, compile, and upload it to your microcontroller.

## Usage

1. **Set Up Hardware:**
   - Connect the camera to the microcontroller.
   - Connect the LED bulbs to the appropriate pins on the microcontroller.

2. **Run the System:**
   Power up your microcontroller. The system will start recognizing hand gestures and lighting up the LEDs based on the number of fingers detected.
